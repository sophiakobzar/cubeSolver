# 3D Rubik's Cube Solver

This project is a 3D Rubik's Cube simulation and solver. It provides an interactive 3D representation of a Rubik's Cube that you can manipulate and solve with a built-in algorithm.

## Features

- **3D Representation**: Visualize and interact with a Rubik's Cube in 3D.
- **Mouse Controls**: Rotate the cube and move pieces using mouse interactions.
- **Solver**: Automatically solve the cube using the built-in algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies for building the interactive interface.
- **3D Transformations**: CSS 3D transformations for creating the 3D effect.

## Getting Started
